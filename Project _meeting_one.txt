1st level You are stuck and can only use rotation to fire, (no sideways movement, only rotational fire)- Death by reaching bottom of screen(?)	
2nd level classic space invaders, (sideways movement and rotational fire)- Death by reaching bottom of screen
3rd level completely breaks free from the restraints and goes against a boss- Death by boss reaching you(?)

Story mode / endless mode

Start with classic space invaders and endless mode, then story

different characters/ skins with differents themes
different stats to chose before you start => more variety
